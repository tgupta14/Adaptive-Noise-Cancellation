# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation

Please refer to the document named "Frequency Domain Adaptive Noise Cancellation" for a detailed description.

The primary microphone is picking up speech and background noise from a certain noise source. Corrupted_Speech.wav is the file that has a conversation between two individuals corrupted by background white noise. 

White_Noise.wav contains the background white noise acquired by a secondary microphone that is located close to the noise source but sufficiently far from the primary microphone.

Filtered_Speech.wav is the audio file generated after applying noise cancellation on the corrupted speech.
